Repo: https://github.com/rooqidev

I started this Things Todo app development just recently in October 2025 â€” itâ€™s my first long-term build that will keep evolving as I learn and improve my front-end skills.
### ðŸ”§ Improvements Made This Week
- Added Scroll flow in task List
- Task editing after adding(Double tap on task to rename it)

### Improvements Updates a few days

- Added Hamburger Menu with functional buttons  
- Implemented Dark Mode for better viewing experience  
- Added a Filtering System to clearly see done and undone tasks  
- Created a Modal Pop-Up for delete confirmation (to prevent accidental deletion of incomplete tasks)

Iâ€™ll continue updating and upgrading this project as I experiment with new ideas and features using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
