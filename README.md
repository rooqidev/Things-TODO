# Things-TODO | My First Long-Term Project

I started this Things Todo app development in October 2025 â€” itâ€™s my first long-term build that will keep evolving as I learn and improve my front-end skills.

### ðŸ”§ Improvements Made This Week
- Added Hamburger Menu with functional buttons  
- Implemented Dark Mode for better viewing experience  
- Added a Filtering System to clearly see done and undone tasks  
- Created a Modal Pop-Up for delete confirmation (to prevent accidental deletion of incomplete tasks)

Iâ€™ll continue updating and upgrading this project as I experiment with new ideas and features using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
